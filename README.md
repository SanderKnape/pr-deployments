# Pull request deployments with GitHub Actions and GitHub Deployments

The workflow in this repository shows how a `/deploy` comment on a pull request can deploy the source code to an environment. In addition, the user is kept up-to-date on the deployment status using the GitHub Deployments construct.

More information about this workflow can be found in my blog post: [Deploy your pull requests with GitHub Actions and GitHub Deployments](https://sanderknape.com/2020/05/deploy-pull-requests-github-actions-deployments/)
